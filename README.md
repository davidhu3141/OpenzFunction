Drawing net for polyhedrons expressed by z = f(x, y)

So that you can make real 3D model for some mathematical 2D surface.

For example:

This is the 2-D Taylor's approximation of z = sinx * siny / 2, up to cubic polynomial.

I photoshoped the picture (*the darker part of the model isn't real*) since I only make half of the model. Finishing the whole model would take too much time.
