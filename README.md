=============

Drawing net for polyhedrons / surfaces expressed by z = f(x, y)

So that you can make real 3D model for some mathematical 2D surface.

Site (in progress)
------------------

This page for example, generates net for surface z = ( x^2 + y^2 ) / 4 now.

UI will be made soon.

Example

This is the 2-D Taylor's approximation of z = sinx * siny / 2, up to cubic polynomial.

I photoshoped the picture (*the darker part of the model isn't real*) since I only make half of the model. Finishing the whole model would take too much time.
