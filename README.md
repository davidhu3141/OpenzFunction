OpenzFunction
=============

Drawing net for polyhedrons / surfaces expressed by z = f(x, y)

So that you can make real 3D model for some mathematical 2D surface.

Simple UI provided.

Example

This surface is a defined by a cubic polynomial z = x^3/6 + ... + y^3/6.

I photoshoped the picture (*the darker part of the model isn't real*) since I only made half of the model. Finishing the whole model would take too much time.
